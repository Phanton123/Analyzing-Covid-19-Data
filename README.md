# Analyzing-Covid-19-Data''
The code in COVID_Portfolio analyzes the covid-19 data from date 2020-01-01 to 2021-11-01 and every country in the country in the world. I preprocessed the data across 65 columns, 127818 rows. Analyzed the preprocessed data using metrics, such as, Total_cases, Rolling_vaccinations, PercentPopulationInfected etc. Used Joins, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Temp Tables and created views to measure individual KPIâ€™s. Used the data from the executed queries and imported it into tableau for visualizations. Forecasted 
previously analyzed data to predict future trends.
