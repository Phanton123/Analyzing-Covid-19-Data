# Analyzing-Covid-19-Data''
The code in COVID_Portfolio analyzes the covid-19 data from date 2020-01-01 to 2021-11-01 and every country in the country in the world. I preprocessed the data across 65 columns, 127818 rows. Analyzed the preprocessed data using metrics, such as, Total_cases, Rolling_vaccinations, PercentPopulationInfected etc. Used Joins, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Temp Tables and created views to measure individual KPI’s. Used the data from the executed queries and imported it into tableau for visualizations. Forecasted 
previously analyzed data to predict future trends.
